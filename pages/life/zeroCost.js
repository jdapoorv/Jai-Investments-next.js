                A term insurance plan provides a substantial payout to your
                beneficiaries in the unfortunate event of your demise. If you
                purchase such a plan at a young and healthy age, you can secure
                a coverage of 1 Crore for a relatively modest annual premium of
                approximately ₹10,000. This already presents an excellent value
                proposition. Now, envision taking it a step further—imagine
                obtaining this term insurance plan and securing coverage without
                any financial outlay.

                This is the commitment of zero-cost plans, and in this article,

                The Mechanism Behind Zero-Cost Term Plans
              </h2>
              <p className="dark:text-gray-200">"
                Zero-cost term insurance plans operate by committing to refund
                your premiums at a predetermined date, effectively reducing your
                total expenditure to zero. In theory, you could purchase a term
                insurance plan, make the usual premium payments for a specified
                number of years, and then opt to forfeit the policy, with all
                your premiums returned to you on this date. This means you can
                access the benefits without any financial outlay.
              </p>
              <p className="dark:text-gray-200">"
                However, this approach might appear puzzling. Why would an
                insurance provider offer to extend a term plan at no cost? How
                could they sustain a profitable business model, particularly
                when most companies handle numerous claims annually, amounting
                to substantial sums?
              </p>
              <p className="dark:text-gray-200">"
                The reality is that insurance companies impose various
                conditions before granting such plans. Let's examine a case
                study based on a zero-cost plan provided by a prominent life
                insurance company in India.
              </p>
              <p className="dark:text-gray-200">"
                Case Study: A 30-year-old individual is interested in purchasing
                a term insurance plan, and the insurance provider suggests the
                zero-cost variant to secure the sale. The customer agrees.
                However, before finalizing the contract, the insurance company
                will require the individual to buy a policy with a maturity age
                of 70 or older. They will explain that the zero-cost variant is
                exclusively available for policies with a term lasting 40 years
                or more. Furthermore, they will stipulate that the policy must
                be surrendered before the 25th policy year or between the ages
                of 65 and 66, whichever occurs earlier. In the case of the
                30-year-old, the individual would need to surrender the policy
                as soon as they turn 55 to receive the premium refunds. Once the
                policy is surrendered, it cannot be renewed, and it will be
                terminated.
              </p>
              <p className="dark:text-gray-200">"
                In summary, while these plans are marketed as zero-cost options,
                they come with several conditions and aren't truly cost-free.
                Nonetheless, since you can access this option without paying
                additional premiums, it might appear tempting. Nevertheless, in
                our opinion, this isn't always the most advisable choice.
              </p>

                Verify sub-limits based on the type of illness
              </h2>
              <p className="dark:text-gray-200">"
                Imagine you're 35 and looking to buy a term plan. Now if you
                spoke to our IRDAI-certified advisors they would tell you that
                you need to select a policy term based on your expected age of
                retirement. So if you were retiring at 60, we would ideally tell
                you to buy a policy with a term of 25 years. That way you'd have
                coverage until your retirement.
              </p>
              <p className="dark:text-gray-200">"
                The logic here is simple. A term plan should cover your
                dependents and offer monetary benefits that resemble your own
                earning potential. And since after retirement your children and
                spouse don't usually depend on you, it doesn't make sense to buy
                a term plan that offers coverage beyond this age. Obviously, you
                could go up to 65 or 70 depending on your own needs, but we
                don't usually recommend buying a policy that lasts beyond 70
                because of the extra premium you'll likely end up paying and the
                general lack of utility that a term plan has to offer.
              </p>
              <p className="dark:text-gray-200">"
                Now imagine you are convinced by the logic, you save a few
                thousand rupees every year and you get a term plan that offers
                exactly the coverage you need. However the allure of a zero cost
                option may affect your decision. If you are told that you can
                avail this benefit only if the policy term breaches 40 years,
                then you may be tempted to buy a policy that offers you coverage
                until the age of 75 (your current age 35 + policy term 40) even
                though you only really needed a policy that lasts until the age
                of 60. This pushes your premium higher. So while you can avail a
                zero cost plan without paying an additional premium, you may
                still end up spending a lot more money than you would have
                otherwise.
              </p>
              <p className="dark:text-gray-200">"
                Secondly, the insurance company will return all your premiums at
                some future date as a lumpsum. But this is not equal to the
                total cost you end up paying to buy and retain the policy in the
                first place. The ₹10,000 you pay in premium isn't the same as
                the ₹10,000 the insurance policy returns some 25 years later. It
                could be worth as little ₹2,000 in today's money because of
                inflation. So you have to remember that there's a hidden cost
                here which doesn't factor into your calculation.
              </p>
              <p className="dark:text-gray-200">"
                But that's not all, the insurance company will only return the
                premiums you've paid them during the time the policy remained
                active. They will not return the GST.
              </p>
              <p className="dark:text-gray-200">"
                And finally, the insurance company can make this work, because
                most people forfeit the policy before the term is complete. This
                is when most of the claims usually pop up. It's in these
                advanced ages that insurance companies have to make substantial
                payouts due to the higher mortality rates. But if they can get
                people to forfeit the policy much earlier, they can get away
                with paying a much smaller amount. In effect, the economics is
                always in favour of the insurance company. So the question is -
                What are the real benefits of buying a zero cost plan?
              </p>

                <li>
                  Furthermore, the decision is entirely in your hands. You can
                  opt to continue with the policy until it reaches maturity or
                  exercise the zero-cost option by surrendering the policy—your
                  choice entirely.

                <li>
                  If you are in your early twenties and you are purchasing a
                  policy with a term of 40 years or more, it can be a worthwhile
                  benefit. Opting for the zero-cost plan incurs no additional
                  cost, making it a sensible choice.
